        <p>Hi PVC! My name is Jennifer and I am so excited that I was chosen to be your President for this school year. I am currently a third year Molecular Environmental Biology major minoring in Spanish. Throughout high school I volunteered at a shelter as an animal socializer and at Happy Hollow Zoo in San Jose as a wildlife education ambassador. Joining PVC has opened me up to so many more opportunities to learn, such as volunteering with low cost vaccine clinics, private practices, and the veterinarian at Oakland Animal Services. I also have worked at University Veterinary Hospital for the past year as an exam room nurse! In the future, I hope to work with low income pet owners both in the US and internationally or in an emergency hospital environment.</p>
        <p>Aside from my dreams of being a veterinarian, I enjoy spending my time playing with my cat Whiskers, watching movies, listening to music, traveling with friends, making pottery, and reading. Some other interesting facts are that I grew up in the South Bay and that I have been vegan since 2015 — if anyone else is vegan or interested in veganism, I love exploring vegan restaurants in and around Berkeley! I look forward to getting to know all of you, and I am always open to answer questions or just hang out :)</p>

        <p>Hi! My name is Heidi and I’m your Internal VP for the year. I’m a 3rd year MEB major (with an animal health and behavior focus!) and I love all animals, big and small, furry or scale-y! Becoming a vet was a childhood dream I always doubted would be the real career path I chose, but after joining PVC my freshman year, I realized that I couldn’t imagine myself not walking this path. I’m so excited to pass on the legacy and help you all realize your passions and dreams, too! In terms of interests, I’m looking into lab vet medicine, wildlife/exotics, shelter, emergency, or animal behavior research, but who knows where I’ll end up in the years to come? :)</p> 
        <p>When I’m not busy with PVC, I’m catching it up with my friends on foodventures all around Berkeley and LA, where I grew up. (Koreatown, born and raised!) I really love trying new places to eat, so hit me up with all your best recommendations! ;) Some other things I love are traveling, photography, interior designing, anything DIY, graphic design, binge-watching kdrama, and crying over cute animal videos. Feel free to hit me up anytime and show me cute pictures of your pets! I will seriously love both your pet and you with all my heart ❤️”</p>

        <p>Hi, I’m Kristin. I’m a fourth year MCB Neurobiology major, and being in MCB, I found most of my peers were pre-med, so I thought  I was too. But as the semesters passed, I realized I wasn’t necessarily interested in going to medical school, and I felt lost. It wasn’t until I started looking at the things I liked, like volunteering as a dog walker at BACS, and cuddling my pupper, that I began to pursue this path in veterninary medicine. I have had so many opportunities, from interning at a wildlife center to now working at PETS Referral Center in Berkeley as an Assistant Vet Tech. I hope to give you all the same opportunities that helped me realize this was the path I wanted to take. Please feel free to email me with suggestions of field trips or workshops that could help enrich your experience here at Cal as a Pre-Vet. When not thinking about animals all day, I love hiking,  working out, painting, and listening to music. I also am a part of Improv4Charity, and love improv and theatre!</p>

        <p>Hello. I’m Edwin, your treasurer for the year. I’m a 4th year Bioengineering student. I have loved animals, both large and small, for all my life, but I actually only decided to become pre-vet at the end of my 2nd year at Cal. I was able to find PVC after a quick google search about veterinary medicine at Berkeley, and it has been a great help in providing opportunities and advice on how I could jump into the field. Since PVC has given so much to me, I wanted to give back and help other students experience the opportunities that I have. In my free time, I enjoy eating, napping, listening to music, reading, and watching movies (usually horror). If you have any fundraising ideas or just want to hang out, feel free to hit me up on facebook or through email.</p>

        <p>Hi! I’m Sarah. I’m the PVC secretary and public relations officer this year. I’m a junior majoring in MEB. I’ve always always loved animals, so my career goals have always revolved around working with animals in some way. Becoming a veterinarian would be a dream come true. I’m especially interested in zoo, exotic, and marine medicine, but I enjoy learning more about all areas of veterinary medicine. In my spare time, I enjoy watching TV shows and movies (especially horror and mystery, but also Disney stuff) and I will never say no to free food. If you ever want to talk about club activities or if you have any ideas for socials you’d like to see us do, come talk to me! </p>
